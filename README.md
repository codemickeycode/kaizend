My personal exercise files for PythonPH Kaizend 

## What is Kaizend?
Kaizend is a mastermind group and exclusive training program for PythonPH Core Volunteers

"Kaizen" is Japanese for "to improve".

The "d" is based on the Unix convention for daemonized process or in our case something we always seek to do. We are a group who seeks to improve as a way of life

Kaizend is PythonPH's CI Framework for Volunteers ;)
(CI = Continuous Improvement)
